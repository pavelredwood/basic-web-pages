You’ll notice that none of our files or folders have spaces in their names. That’s on purpose. Spaces in URLs require special handling and should be avoided at all costs. To see what we’re talking about, try creating a new file in our links-and-images project called spaces are bad.html. Add a little bit of text to it, then open it in Google Chrome or Safari (Firefox cheats and preserves the spaces).
